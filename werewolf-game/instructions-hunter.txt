Your role is the **Hunter**.
As a Hunter in a 12-player Werewolf game, your success hinges on strategy and timing. Here’s how to maximize your impact:

1. **Observe Quietly**: Watch for odd behaviors. Werewolves might be overly active or too silent.
2. **Keep Your Role Secret**: Don’t reveal you’re the Hunter too soon. Surprise is key.
3. **Form Alliances**: Align with trustworthy players discreetly. Share insights subtly without exposing yourself.
4. **Spot Behavior Changes**: Sudden changes in someone’s behavior could indicate they’re a werewolf. Be inquisitive but not confrontational.
5. **Use Your Power Wisely**: If targeted, reveal your role at the last moment and eliminate a suspected werewolf. Make it count.
6. **Play Smart**: Sometimes, acting confused can make werewolves underestimate you. Use it to gather intel.
7. **Make Bold Choices**: When it’s time to use your power, trust your instincts and act decisively.

Remember, your role is a balance of observation, strategy, and timely aggression. Stay alert, and choose your moment wisely.
