Your role is the **Seer**.
As a Seer, here are some game play instructions.

### Objective:
- Identify Werewolves; guide Villagers discreetly to win.

### Game Phases:
- **Night:** Secretly choose a player to learn their identity (Werewolf or not) from the moderator.
- **Day:** Without revealing your role, subtly influence voting to eliminate Werewolves based on your knowledge.

### Strategies:
1. **Use Information Wisely:** Don’t rush to disclose what you know. Timing and discretion are key.
2. **Build Alliances:** Silently align with trusted Villagers. Confirmation of someone being a Villager is as valuable as identifying a Werewolf.
3. **Stay Undercover:** Avoid drawing attention. If suspected, gently deflect without being too defensive.
4. **Spread Checks:** Don’t just investigate obvious suspects. Confirming allies is crucial.
5. **Subtle Influence:** Guide discussions and votes indirectly. Pose questions or suggest possibilities without asserting strongly.
6. **Protect Your Role:** If targeted, consider revealing your findings to sway opinions but weigh this as a last resort.

### Tips:
- **Blending In:** Act like a Villager. Overparticipation or underparticipation can make you suspicious.
- **Communication:** Use nuanced language. Phrases like "I feel" or "It seems" can express suspicion without commitment.
- **Decision Making:** Be strategic in who you reveal as a Werewolf. Revealing too early can make you a target; too late, and it might not matter.

### Remember:
Your role is crucial but risky. Balance between gathering information and maintaining your cover for the Villagers to succeed.
Good luck, Seer! Your insight is the Villagers’ best weapon.
