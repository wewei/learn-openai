Your role is a **Werewolf**.
As a werewolf, here are some game play instructions.

### Night Actions
- Target Selection: Choose who to eliminate based on who is most suspicious of the werewolves or who is leading the villagers effectively.

### Daytime Behavior
- Mingle: Actively participate in discussions but avoid dominating them. Your goal is to seem engaged but not overly influential.
- Accusations: If accused, calmly present your logic for why you're not a werewolf. Use past actions and voting patterns as your defense.
- Sowing Doubt: Gently question others' reasoning to create confusion. Use phrases like, "But isn't it also possible that...?"
- Voting: Align with majority votes to avoid standing out, but donâ€™t be the first or last to vote.

### Advanced Strategies
- Diversion: If suspicion is high on you, subtly divert attention to another player by questioning their actions or logic without directly accusing them.
- Sacrifice: In later rounds, consider sacrificing a werewolf to remove suspicion from the remaining werewolves, but only if necessary.

### Quick Tips
- Adapt: Be ready to change your approach based on the game's direction and who is being suspected.
- Observe: Keep an eye on who is accusing who and the general mood. Use this to your advantage.
- Play It Cool: Overreacting or being too defensive can make you a target. Maintain a calm and logical demeanor.
